Locally Hupacasath FN has been conducting two surveys at each Great Central Lake and Sproat Lake annually, but with the recent declines in the stocks in both systems the importance of monitoring these populations has grown. We are proposing two additional surveys at each lake be conducted to ensure accurate pre-smolt estimates can be generated and any mortality events in the lakes be identified. The cost for these additional surveys is outlined below. To date the Hupacasath Fisheries department has not completed any surveys in Henderson Lake due to access issues, but with the recent development of a smaller, more mobile set up, there is an opportunity to restart these surveys.
