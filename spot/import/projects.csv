Surveys may extend into January 2020 if spawning extends that late. Biological samples from spawned carcasses will be collected to determine the average lengths, age structure, pre-spawn mortality incidence and genetic baseline information. Work activities will include the following:   1. Conduct stream walks in the creek tributaries to Sakinaw Lake. The target creeks are; Sakinaw Lake outlet canal, Mixal, Haskins, Boat Ramp Lower Ruby, Prospector and Kokomo Creeks. Foot surveys will be conducted at a minimum of once per week to identify the timing of spawners entering and the numbers of spawning coho in each creek. The creeks will be accessed by truck and boat. For each creek surveyed, a Stream Inspection Log (SIL) will be filled out.    2.  Carcass recovery/sampling by locating spawned out fish and sampling on the grounds. When carcasses are located, biosample each carcass as instructed by DFO Stock Assessment staff, and complete biosampling data sheets, scale books and Whatman sheets for DNA analyses, and otoliths.
