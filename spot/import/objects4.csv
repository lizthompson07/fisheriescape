AFS2020-MLT-2024-0-A4,1,"Bio-Samplers will work in conjunction with Nuxalk River Monitors to collect biological samples and provide additional catch monitoring support in the Nuxalk FSC Fishery. This sampling program is designed to: 1.Collect the age and catch information for Atnarko Chinook that is necessary to monitor the wild stock's status over time. 2.Collect samples on Atnarko Sockeye that can be analyzed for changes in growth, age, and genetics over time (before and after the sockeye crash). This has been identified as a very high priority for Atnarko Sockeye in the 2016 Atnarko Sockeye Recovery Plan (Nuxalk Nation, CCIRA) and again at the Atnarko Sockeye Recovery Plan Update meeting in 2019. 3.Additional outcomes are also possible by continuing to collect these samples, such as indexing the proportion of non-Atnarko Chinook present in the FSC catch to estimate total returns to the Bella Coola.  For Chinook: the Bio-Samplers will collect fishing information, the length, mark status, sex, scales, and the snout of AD clipped Chinook. A goal is to sample 20% of the daily non-adipose clipped reported catch to ensure samples are representative of run timing and run size over the fishing season. Samplers will work to sample and collect heads from as many hatchery adipose-clipped fish as possible. Each adipose-clipped fish snout will be collected and tagged with a specific FSC label provided by DFO each year using swift attacher gun. This number will be carefully recorded on each bio-sampling sheet. At the end of each day, chinook snouts will be placed separately without touching each other into a deep freezer. For Sockeye: the Bio-Samplers will collect fishing information, the length, mark status, sex, and 5 scales from as many sockeye as possible. All biological data will be recorded in the datasheet format created by DFO with Nuxalk Stewardship Office before the program starts. Scale books must be filled out completely using pencil by samplers and be kept in a dry place. Staff will be trained how to correctly mount the scales rough-side up.
