Lobster is also the 2nd most important fishery in 3Ps and it reached a record of $28M in landed value this past season.In recent years some serious concerns were raised by Lobster harvesters about the impact of Scallop dragging activity on their lobster fishing grounds. DFO responded between 2016 and 2019 by closing various shallow water areas (less than 20 fathoms) in the eastern portion of Fortune Bay to Scallop dragging. These closures have resulted in a shift of fishing effort to other parts of 3Ps (western Fortune Bay, Hermitage Bay, Connaigre Bay) which led to recent request from industry to close all areas North of 47N to scallop dragging due to concerns about the destruction of Lobster habitat in those areas. The science advice provided will help Resource Management make informed decisions on this matter:  should the areas closed be maintained, reduced or increased; are current closures based on water depth effective; what other types of closures could be possible (based on time of year, vessel speed,etc)?Data will be shared with fish harvester committees, the FFAW, processors, Indigenous organizations and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador during the next 3Ps Lobster advisory, which is likely to take place in late November 2022.","Many questions were raised about Scallop dragging during the 2019 Lobster advisory in 3Ps and there was a request for more research to be done on this topic by Lobster harvesters. Since then the value of the Lobster fishery has increased and so has its importance to harvesters in 3Ps. With the recent increase of scallop dragging in other parts of 3Ps, this topic is expected to be an important one as the November 2022 advisory meeting. Not having science advice to present on this topic at the 2022 Lobster advisory would not be well received by participants. It could negatively impact the ability to manage the Lobster fishery in 3Ps in a sustainable manner and could lead to criticism to the department by industry, notably from the Lobster and Scallop fleets based in 3Ps. ",2022-23,10/14/2022,Providing the  science advice during  the Lobster advisory meeting in November 2022 would allow the department to properly consult 3Ps lobster harvesters and take decisions with regard to  Scallop closures as soon as possible. ,No,,,,12/16/2021,,,,,,,Newfoundland & Labrador
