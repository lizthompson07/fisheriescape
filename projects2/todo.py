# from the main detail, make a review page from which you can then export it

# CLONE FUNCTION

# once a project is submitted you should go to the review page, not the detail page
## actually, since the latest update, the review page can probably be highly simplified since all the information is displayed on the detail page.
# - collaborators should be specified as external collaborators (could be a drop down);
# - should be a many-to-many relationship with other projects (link related projects)
# when projects are unsubmitted, they should also get unapproved?

# - project labels field


# - admin view for approvals (a place where admins can check to see if everything has been approved etc.)
# - report: QC report for project staff --> are the users connected as expected?


# - report: FTE stand-alone report; sorting in desc order; for approved projects only.
# - report: Doug's report
# - report: OT report
# - report: OT by program
# - report: list of external collabs
# - report: salary $ + O&M  (desc by o&M)

# - update translation file


# - help tooltips
# start date of project re: fiscal year
